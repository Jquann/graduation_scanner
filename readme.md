## üîÑ Migration from Previous Versions

To migrate from older versions:

1. Backup your existing `graduation_data` folder
2. Install the new version in a fresh directory
3. Copy your `graduation_data` folder to the new location
4. Install new dependencies (especially Pillow for certificate generation)
5. Run the application - existing data will be preserved
6. Access new certificate display through the scanning tab

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Face detection slow**: Switch to `low_cpu` mode or reduce detection frequency
2. **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed, especially TensorFlow and Pillow
3. **QR decode errors**: Install system zbar library (see Prerequisites)
4. **TensorFlow not found**: Install TensorFlow using: `pip install tensorflow>=2.13.0`
5. **Anti-spoofing disabled**: Ensure TensorFlow is properly installed and models can be loaded
6. **TTS not working**: Check pyttsx3 installation and system audio configuration
7. **Export/Import errors**: Ensure openpyxl is installed for Excel functionality
8. **Student ID validation**: Use format 11AAA11111 (2 digits + 3 letters + 5 digits)
9. **Attendance not updating**: Ensure database permissions are correct and storage is available
10. **Certificate display not showing**: Ensure Pillow is installed and display window has focus
11. **Certificate styling issues**: Check font availability and canvas size settings

### Performance Issues

- For older systems: Use `low_cpu` mode and reduce camera resolution
- For memory issues: Reduce buffer sizes in configuration
- For slow recognition: Check face image quality and lighting conditions
- For certificate display lag: Ensure adequate RAM and close unnecessary applications

### Certificate Display Issues

1. **Certificate not appearing**: Check if certificate window is minimized or behind other windows
2. **Blurry text**: Ensure adequate screen resolution and proper fullscreen mode
3. **Layout issues**: Test different screen resolutions and aspect ratios
4. **Font problems**: System fonts are used; ensure standard fonts are available
